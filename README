NAME
    Time::Concise - Convert to and from concise duration formats.

SYNOPSIS
      use Time::Concise;
      my $seconds = from_concise "5y4d3h2m1s"; # 158141171
      my $concise =   to_concise 158141171;    # 5y4d3h2m1s

DESCRIPTION
    Time::Concise exports two functions by default, "from_concise" and
    "to_concise".

    The term *concise* was borrowed from Time::Duration.

  Concise Format
    The format is an integer followed immediatley by its duration
    identifier. White-space will be ignored.

    The following table explains the format.

      identifier   duration
      ----------   --------
               y   year
               d   day
               h   hour
               m   minute
               s   second

  Functions
    to_concise *$seconds*
            This function requires one argument, an integer number of
            seconds, and returns a concise string representation of the
            duration.

            If the input is not an integer this function returns "undef".

    from_concise *$concise*
            This function requires one argument, a concise string
            representation of the duration, and returns the number of
            seconds in the duration.

            If the concise string contains characters outside those
            represented in a concise duration string this function will
            return "undef".
